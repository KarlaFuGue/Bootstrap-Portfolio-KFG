## See My Work - Bootstrap

I'm a Front-end Developer Starter, and eager learner of the digital world.
The interests for Web Development started when my partner launched his own building company, and started to work on the media and advertising. However, it wasn't until I had the opportunity to work for a company which offers ERP Solutions, where I took the decision to follow this path.

The purpose of this project, is to show people the new skills that I have been getting during my learning journey. This time will be showing my bootstrap skills.

I know this will be just one of many portfolios I'm going to build, as this is just the beginning of this journey, and I'll continue improving after the constant practice.
